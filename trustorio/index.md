# Trustorio: Restoring the Integrity of Student-Teacher Relations


## Privacy and integrity for today's learning
Trustorio views each exam, remote or in-person, as a step closer to learners satisfying the constraints their instructors have set up. That’s why our platform makes assessments accessible to anyone, at any time, anywhere.


## Our platform
Retaining trust in students and instructors is essential to protecting the reputation of your institution and the success of your test takers.

Trustorio’s patented NoProctor™ system, self-identity reminders, privacy protection tools, and foundation of trust make up the ethical tool box within your assessment platform to ensure your remote assessment’s integrity.


## Our values

### Keeping the exam between test takers and test givers.
Trustorio doesn't hold any data and doesn't require any personally-identifiable information. We aim to keep our involvement in the exam process as transparent as possible.

### Doing things the right way from the very start.
We designed our products with test-taker privacy and convenience in mind, which is why all our services are unscheduled and require zero support.
